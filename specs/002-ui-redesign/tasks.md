## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational completion
  - US1 (P1): Independent after Foundational
  - US2 (P2): Independent after Foundational (can integrate with US1 components)
  - US3 (P3): Independent after Foundational
  - US4 (P4): Depends on US1, US2, US3 completion (adds responsive styles to existing components)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Foundational → Independent
- **US2 (P2)**: Foundational → Independent (may reuse Button from US1 but not blocking)
- **US3 (P3)**: Foundational → Independent
- **US4 (P4)**: US1 + US2 + US3 → Adds responsive styles to all existing components

### Within Each User Story

1. Component tests (if testing first approach)
2. Visual components (can parallelize [P] tasks)
3. Integration/composition components
4. Visual regression tests (for US4)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T006, T007 parallel  
**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T009, T010, T011, T012, T013 parallel; T017 parallel with T018  
**Phase 3 (US1 Tests)**: T019, T020, T021 parallel  
**Phase 3 (US1 Impl)**: T022, T023, T024 parallel  
**Phase 4 (US2 Tests)**: T030, T031, T032 parallel  
**Phase 4 (US2 Impl)**: T033 parallel with T034, T035  
**Phase 5 (US3 Tests)**: T040, T041, T042 parallel  
**Phase 5 (US3 Impl)**: T043, T044 parallel  
**Phase 6 (US4 Tests)**: T050, T051, T052 parallel  
**Phase 6 (US4 Impl)**: T053, T054 parallel; T055, T056, T057 sequential (same file); T058, T059 sequential; T060, T061 sequential  
**Phase 7 (Polish)**: T064, T065, T066, T067 parallel; T069, T070 parallel; T072, T073 parallel; T074, T075, T076 parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T018) - CRITICAL GATE
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T029)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test preference setting page independently
5. Deploy/demo MVP with refreshed green-themed preference UI

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Design system ready
2. Add US1 → Preference setting redesigned → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add US2 → Workout list redesigned → Deploy/Demo
4. Add US3 → Training player immersive → Deploy/Demo
5. Add US4 → Responsive everywhere → Deploy/Demo
6. Polish → Accessibility + Performance → Final Release

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (after Foundational Phase 2 completes):

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Preference Form)
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Workout List)
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Training Player)
- **Developer D**: User Story 4 waits for A+B+C, then adds responsive styles

Stories integrate independently, can be demoed separately.

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map task to user story for traceability
- **Foundational phase blocks everything**: Must complete before any UI work
- **Each user story independently testable**: Can demo/deploy after completion
- **US4 adds responsive styles**: Depends on US1/US2/US3 completion
- **Tests optional**: Included for quality assurance, adjust based on team preference
- **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical group
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate story works independently before continuing

---

## Total Task Count

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 11 tasks
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: 11 tasks (3 tests + 8 implementation)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: 10 tasks (3 tests + 7 implementation)
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: 14 tasks (3 visual tests + 11 implementation)
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: 15 tasks

**Total: 78 tasks**

**Parallel opportunities**: ~35 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**Suggested MVP scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1) = 29 tasks
